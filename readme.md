This script uses the subprocess module to run the command iwlist wlan0 scan which will scan for available wifi networks and parse the output of the command and return the ESSID of the networks.

You can add more functionality to this script as per your requirement, like storing the wifi details in a file or adding a GUI etc.

Please note that above script might not work as is, because it depends on the operating system you're using, and the way wifi interfaces are named.
